### Symptome

PE could not be deleted because have PLS in approved state
And Subscription containing PLS is already marked as deleted
### Triage

- Subscription deletion is not going through
- PLS not successfully deleted
Thus PE still shows connected to PLS when subscription containing PLS is marked as deleted

### Mitigation

first party: ask first party dri to take care of
first party service need to invoke NRP PutPrivateLinkServiceProxy API
(does not matter if PLS is already deleted)

third party:
solution 1: update kvs
solution 2: invoke NRP PutPrivateLinkServiceProxy API

solution 3:
Since we find out PLS is not deleted
we want to invoke remove private endpoint connection from PLS,
and this workflow will automatically delete pls reference on PE
