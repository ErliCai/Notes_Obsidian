### About

Azure space 2020
partner-first approach to rapidly reimagine traditional space solutions, introduce new software-based tools, and minimize cost barriers holding back the space ecosystem.


### early outcome
ground stations
provided resilient connectivity to the hyperscale cloud, and launch a transformational effort to virtualize satellite communications.

### customer

established satellite operators
new start-up
government agencies
enterprises are experimenting with new form factor satellite

### ground stations as a service

### projects

#### KSAT

- The demo focused on data acquisition
- The teams successfully validated space connectivity across KSAT and Microsoft Azure Orbital Ground Station sites
- improving `latency`
- allowed NASA to expand its coverage and connectivity, benefiting from ground station access through a single application programming interface (API), direct backhaul into Azure, cross-region delivery, and a unified data format experience.

#### Muon Space

Muon Space selected Microsoft to support its first-ever launch in June 2023,

- Azure Orbital Ground Station as the `sole ground station provider` for their MuSat-1 mission
- From the launch and early operation (LEOP) stage to continuous on-orbit operations, Microsoft ground stations around the world are used to `successfully communicate`
- Azure Orbital Ground Station is a completely cloud-based solution. Therefore, `hardware deployment was not needed`, enabling Muon Space to take advantage of an innovative virtual radio frequency (RF) solution with a custom modem.

#### Planetary Computer 

Planetary Computer is a robust geospatial data platform. 
-  combines a `multi-petabyte` catalog of global multi-source data with intuitive APIs, a` flexible scientific environment` that allows users to answer global questions about that data, and applications that put those answers in the hands of many stakeholders

### next step

- create an end-to-end space fabric
- providing ubiquitous connectivity, resiliency, and global insights at scale, in real-time.
