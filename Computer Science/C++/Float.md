The floating-point types represent single-, double-, and extended-precision values. The standard specifies a minimum number of significant digits. Most compilers provide more precision than the specified minimum. Typically, `float`s are represented in one word (32 bits), `double`s in two words (64 bits), and `long double`s in either three or four words (96 or 128 bits).
