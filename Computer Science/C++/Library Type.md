The built-in [[Type|type]] are defined directly by the C++ language. These types represent facilities present in most computer hardware, such as numbers or characters. The standard library defines a number of additional types of a higher-level nature that computer hardware usually does not implement directly.

example of library types: [[String|string]] and `vector`

In addition to specifying the operations that the library types provide, the standard also imposes efficiency requirements on implementors. As a result, library types are efficient enough for general use.
