A value, such as `42`, is known as a literal because its value self-evident.

### Interger Literal

- decimal:  20
- octal: 024
- hexidecimal: 0x14
- binary:  0b10100

Although integer literals may be stored in signed types, technically speaking, **the value of a decimal literal is never a negative number**. If we write what appears to be a negative decimal literal, for example, `-42`, the minus sign is _not_part of the literal. The minus sign is an operator that negates the value of its (literal) operand.


### Floating Literal

Floating-point literals include either a decimal point or an exponent specified using scientific notation

e.g: 3.14159    3.14159E0    0.    0e0    .001

### Character and Character String Literals

```
'a'  // character literal  
"Hello World!"  // string literal
```
