### Build-in types

- bool <-> arithematic, true <->1 and false <-> 0
- floating -> integral, truncated
- integral -> floating, the fractional part is zero. Precision may be lost if the integer has more bits than the floating-point object can accommodate
- out-of-range value -> unsigned type, take modulo
- out-of-range value -> signed type, undefined
