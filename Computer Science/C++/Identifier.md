Identifiers in C++ can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character

Identifiers are case-sensitive; upper- and lowercase letters are distinct:
```
// defines four different int variables  
int somename, someName, SomeName, SOMENAME;
```

The language reserves a set of names for its own use:
