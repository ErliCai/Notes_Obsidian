Static Typing means that types are checked at compile time

The type of an object constrains the operations that the object can perform. In C++, the compiler checks whether the operations we write are supported by the types we use.

Static type checking can help find bugs. However, a consequence of static checking is that the type of every entity we use must be known to the compiler. As one example, we must declare the type of a variable before we can use that variable.
