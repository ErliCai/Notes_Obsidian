The standard guarantees minimum sizes as listed below. However, compilers are allowed to use larger sizes for these types. Because the number of bits varies, the largest (or smallest) value that a type can represent also varies.

The language guarantees that an `int` will be at least as large as `short`, a `long` at least as large as an `int`, and `long long` at least as large as `long`. The type `long long` was introduced by the new standard.
