Preprocessor is a program that runs before the compiler. 

eg. NULL is the preprocessor variable that `cstdlib` header defines as `0`

When we use a preprocessor variable, the preprocessor automatically replaces the variable by its value

Hence, initializing a pointer to `NULL` is equivalent to initializing it to `0`.
