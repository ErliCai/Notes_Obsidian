Program files are normally referred to as a source files. On most systems, the name of a source file ends with a suffix, which is a period followed by one or more characters. The suffix tells the system that the file is a C++ program. Different compilers use different suffix conventions; the most common include `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.cpp`, `.cp`, and `.C`.
