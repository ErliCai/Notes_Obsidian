- An identifier should give some indication of its meaning
- Variable names normally are lowercase—`index`, not `Index` or `INDEX`
- classes we define usually begin with an uppercase letter
- Identifiers with multiple words should visually distinguish each word, for example, `student_loan` or `studentLoan`, not `studentloan`.
