An uninitialized variable has an indeterminate value. Trying to use the value of an uninitialized variable is an error that is often hard to debug. Moreover, the compiler is not required to detect such errors, although most will warn about at least some uses of uninitialized variables.

What happens when we use an uninitialized variable is **undefined**

Sometimes, weâ€™re lucky and our program crashes as soon as we access the object. Once we track down the location of the crash, it is usually easy to see that the variable was not properly initialized. Other times, the program completes but produces erroneous results. Even worse, the results may appear correct on one run of our program but fail on a subsequent run.
