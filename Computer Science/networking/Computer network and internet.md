### What is Internet

#### basic hardware and software components

![[some pieces of internet.png]]
- `devices`: The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world
    In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called hosts or end systems
- `connections`: End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches
    different types of physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum
    Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the `transmission rate` of a link measured in bits/second
- `packets`: When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as packets in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data
- `hardware`: routers and link-layer switches.
    Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are typically used in the network core
- `ISP` (Internet Service Providers):End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers
    ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL, high-speed local area network access, and mobile wireless access
    These lower- tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs
- `protocols`: TCP/IP and others
- `standard`: RFCs

#### Transportation analogue
packets - truck
communication links - highway
packet switch - intersections
end system - buildings (destinations)
